# TemperatureValue
This project is a rethinking of the idea from temperature conversion to
having temperature as a value type instead.

Each created Temperature value type can be created in on of the following scales: Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin, and Rankine.   
From the defined scale the Temperature value type would allow conversion between any one of the four scales as needed.
